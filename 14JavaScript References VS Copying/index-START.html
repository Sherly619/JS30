    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let name = 'Arvin';
    // let name2 = name;
    // name = 'Sherly';
    // console.log(name, name2);


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players.slice();
    players2[3] = 'Sherly';
    const players3 = Array.from(players);
    players3[3] = 'Sherly';

    const players4 = [...players];
    players4[3] = 'Sherly';

    const players5 = [].concat(players);
    players5[3] = 'Sherly';


    console.log(players, players2, players3, players4, players5);


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Arvin',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        wechat: 'Alice --',
        facebook: '--Alice--'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Sherly Yang' });

    const person3 = { ...person };
    person3.name = 'Sherly Yang';
    // person3.social.wechat = 'Barly';

    console.log(person, person2, person3);

    const person4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    person4.social.wechat = 'Barly';

    console.log(person, person4);
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
